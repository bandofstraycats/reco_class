# Learning representations using Deep learning for Recommendation

The objective of this class is to present deep representation learning methods for recommendation task.
This class was presented at [SFdS](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/).

## Contents
### Introduction to deep learning
### Multi-layer neural network
* Practical exercise on building deep network for recommendation
### Learning user and item representations
* Learning item representation using Convolution Neural Network
* Practical exercise on adding movie poster representation into deep network
* Learning user representation using Recurrent Neural Network

The practical exercise shows how to build deep network for recommendation on [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/).

### Practical details.
AWS EC2 public image: ami-49cff25f is configured to run the exercise.
